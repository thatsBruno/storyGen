# storyGen

- This project is a test on how the OpenAIs API works, essentially this backend service has one single endpoint that receives a story, and return images based on that story. 
- In detail it makes two requests, one for splitting the story into 'frames' or parts, and another that generates the image itself and therefore returning in the end the urls of all images generated for the story.
